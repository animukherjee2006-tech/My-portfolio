        Hey, I’m Ani 👋
A curious mind, a problem solver, and someone who believes big things start with small lines of code.

I’m a computer science student who loves turning ideas into real, working products—whether it’s a website, an app, or a backend system that actually scales.
 I’m not just learning tech to pass exams; I’m learning it to build, experiment, and someday create products that make people’s lives easier.

I enjoy diving deep into how things work behind the scenes—APIs, databases, system design, and clean architecture.
